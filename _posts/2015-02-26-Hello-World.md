I've been planing to blog my experiences und humble ideas about software development for a long time. So here it is. I will try to write as often as I can in both English and Turkish.


I have been looking for a solution to build this blog with static pages and preferably using [GitHub](https://github.com) infrastructure. When I've first read about [HubPress](http://hubpress.io) on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9020429) I thought that I should give it a try. But it didn't have all the features I wanted, so I have switched to a  [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) based solution and this post has been edited accordingly. I'm planing to write about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and static page hosting on [GitHub](https://github.com) in another post later.

This post about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) will probably be in Turkish, because there is already quite a lot of documentation about that in English.
